📝 Project Description
Goal: To build a speech-to-text transcription system, possibly for different accents or noisy environments.

📦 Setup
Installs essential libraries: transformers, torchaudio, librosa, openai-whisper, and datasets.

Accepts audio datasets via file upload or direct downloads.

🔊 Audio Preprocessing
Silence removal using librosa.effects.trim.

Normalization of audio signals for consistent input.

Waveform visualization for cleaned audio.

📈 Data Analysis
Visual inspection via spectrograms to detect noise or distortion.

Mentions of accent analysis and possible error analysis of transcriptions.
